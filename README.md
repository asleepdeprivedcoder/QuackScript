Quack Script is a collection of HID payloads originally designed for the Raspberry Pi Pico. It's meant for educational purposes, automation testing, and ethical security research.

What's it for?
These scripts are a fun way to explore how HID (Human Interface Device) attacks work, giving you the tools to automate tasks, test security systems, and learn more about how devices interact in a digital world. It's great for personal security research or testing in a controlled, authorized environment.

Use Responsibly
While it’s a blast to test out the power of automation, misuse is never fun. The scripts should only be used in ethical scenarios, like penetration testing or in a sandbox environment where you have permission to test. The repo owner is not responsible for any illegal or malicious use. Always ensure you're following the law and respecting others' systems.

Remember: With great power comes great responsibility! Please use this for fun, learning, and positive security research—not for harm.
